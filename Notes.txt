	Unsupervised learning in text analysis example.


List of things to remove from text:
	* <Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>
	* Dates
	* Numbers
	* Names?
	* Email addresses
		Names + emails might be enough to remove from the header
	* Special Characters that show up frequently --> '-' and '/'
		Should '&' be replaced with 'and' ?
			NO --> these characters both tagged as CC
	* Other punctuation?
		POS tagging is done before removing punctuation.
		Therefore, lack of punctuation shouldnt affect the meaning of the sentence if removed.
	*
