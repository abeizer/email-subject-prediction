# Email Subject Classification
This project utilizes machine learning concepts to predict the subject of an email body and generate an appropriate subject line for that email.

## Requirements
* __Jupyter Notebook__ (http://jupyter.org/install)
* __Python 3__
* __nltk__ - an open-source natural language processing library (http://www.nltk.org/)
* __Enron Corpus__ - labeled version of emails from emplyees within the Enron corporation (https://data.world/brianray/enron-email-dataset)

_If the Enron dataset is in a zipped format, unzip it. It should now be a single file in .csv format._


## Introduction.ipynb
### Summary
This file sets up the corpus for use in this machine learning project and then goes over common methods for pre-processing text documents.

It is necessary to run cells up until the Methods for Pre-Processing header. This will grab labeled emails from the dataset and save them as their own, labeled dataset.
